The main developer's are:

* POOTTAREN J. CÃ©dric
* BAICHOO Arwin Neil

Introduction
--------------------------------------------

Rashell is developed using Microsoft .NET Framework
Currently, .NET Framework 4.6 is required to run <code>Rashell</code>.

Recompiling using an older version of .NET should not be a problem.
<code>Rashell</code> is created to be fully dynamic and customizable.
Every behaviour of the Shell can be control from a configuration file <code>config.conf</code>. 
that is found in the startup directory of <code>Rashell</code>.


Licence
--------------------------------------------

Rashell is licenced under the CPGSL License Version 4.

Execution via Argument
--------------------------------------------
Rashell supports execution via argument.

Here is a list of the currently support switches:

* `-c` This switch tells Rashell that it/she should execute the command specified. (Example: `rashell.exe -c mkdir %userprofile%\folder`).
* `-e` By default Rashell exits after the command parsed via arguments ends. To prevent that use the switch `-e`. (Example: `rashell.exe -ce mkdir %userprofile%\folder`).
* `-v` By default Rashell doesn't display the command it executes that are parsed via arguments. To make it (she) show the commands use the version (-v) switch. (`Example: rashell.exe -cev mkdir %userprofile%\folder`).

Built-in commands
--------------------------------------------

Rashell has number of buit-in commands.

Here's a list:

* `ls` - List all files and directory. Help command (`ls -h`).
* `mkdir` - Creates a new directory.
* `cd` - Sets the Working Current Directory.
